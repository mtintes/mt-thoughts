<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>My name is Mike Tintes. I'm a DevOps Engineer by trade, but above that I am a tinkerer. I've done standup, been a radio dj, and I enjoy building things that pop into my head. I also love college hockey, so that might be coming up.</p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>Well I guess this blog is going to be mostly about all of the different project I've worked on or interesting anecdotes. I really believe that knowledge should be shared and documented so sometimes these will be stories, sometimes it will be stuff I ran into during projects. I will continue with this later, but netflix is on.
