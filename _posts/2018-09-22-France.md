We got back from france a couple days ago and are almost over the jet lag. It has been 4:30 and 5:00 am wake up times the last few days. France is 7 hours ahead so waking up at 9am there was 2 in the morning here. I stayed up until midnight to try to get my clock back to normal.

## Day 1 Travelling

I don't think I've had a proper vacation in a while, something like a year and a half. I don't normalling take time off, I guess because I enjoy work. I woke up at 4am on the Sunday we left. I had a friend tell me that a great way to fight jet lag is to not eat for 16 hours and then eat at what would be breakfast time at your destination. It's supposed to reset your internal clock or something. I dunno. Anyways, I got up super early in hopes that I could get some sleep on the airplane. Our flight was to take off at 5:30 and If I fell asleep shortly there after I could get pretty close to on time for waking up.

Alex woke up a few hours later and we didn't have much to do so we went to our favorite dinner Wampach's before the morning church crowd could overrun it. We did stuff round the house after and then headed to the airport. We parked at an off-site ramp and shuttled to the airport to save a few bucks. In retrospective, we probably should have taken a cab since it would have come out to about the same price. As the flight takes off I started watching [*Isle of Dogs*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/) which I had missed in theaters. It's a pretty laid back movie so as I started to fall asleep watching it Alex woke me up thinking I was awake. I got about 15 minutes and that rejarred my brain awake to finish the movie. I then watched something else, I forget what and I guess it doesn't matter. 

We got dinner served and I tried unsuccessfully to fall asleep a few more times. After 7 hour flying across the ocean we landed in Paris. at this point it was about 7am there. We had to clear customs which took about 5 minutes and no dumb questions about where we were and why? We had a connecting flight in a different terminal. This was kind of when it started to hit me that neither of us spoke French. I was doing some Babbel courses to get some basics down, but neither of us knew much. We (Alex) managed to figure out where to go. The airport was well laid out and there were just enough english markers to get by. 

Our connecting flight was a couple hours from when we landed and we were both pretty tired at this point. The terminal we were at was really beautiful, but it was built like a triangle so that the far side converged into a point. This would have been fine, except that there were 4 gates less than 100 feet apart. The flight at the gate ahead of us was delayed waiting for someone, so our flight was a little late as well. We got on and made the jump down to Nice. Nice is about a 30-40 minute drive southwest of Monaco where the famous Monaco Grand Prix is held. Our first night in France would be in the town of Cannes, pronounced "Can", because the French don't use most of the letters they write.

### Day 2ish

We found the airport bus terminal and I muttered "deux for Can." They picked up I was american pretty quickly and switched the conversation to english pretty quickly. This would be an overall process to every conversation we would have while in France. We got the tickets and struggled to find the actual bus terminal. Alex ended up finding the right parking lot and we got on the bus. 

She ended up getting sleep on the bus, though the drive wasn't long. We ended up at ["Gare de Cannes"](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cannes,+France/@43.5536843,7.0197858,18.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12ce8180530cffff:0x40819a5fd979e20!8m2!3d43.552847!4d7.017369) It was about [1 km](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Gare+de+Cannes,+4+Place+de+la+Gare,+06400+Cannes,+France/Clarion+Suites+Cannes+Croisette+****,+Rue+Latour-Maubourg,+Cannes,+France/@43.552112,7.0227555,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x12ce81925828015f:0x3b9b2f7c61606d81!2m2!1d7.0195453!2d43.5539536!1m5!1m1!1s0x12ce81bdc89fb7b5:0x44cc31ba34a0214b!2m2!1d7.03032!2d43.550046!3e2) from out first hotel. We decided to walk. Coming from the midwest Cannes was eye opening. Alex and I both have backpacks and suitcases in a place where neither of us speak the language, in a foreign town, with no cell signal. Luckily I had offline google maps so we found our way through some windy streets and found our first hotel. 

It was tucked away a few blocks from the beach. We were both exhausted. At this point I was running on about an hour of sleep for the last 26 hours. The front desk was very polite and switched to english pretty quickly. We got our room went upstairs and just laid on the bed. The room had a queen size mattress with a small chair and a stove, and fridge. Alex figured out that if you put your card in a slot on the wall you could turn the lights on. I am still not sure how she deduced this, but pretty much every hotel would have some form of this. It was a great way to save electricity. We both started falling asleep until she sat up quickly and said, "nope we can't go to bed yet, we have to stay up."  She was right. It was awful, but if we didn't get on schedule right away we weren't going to. 

We walked up to the beach. We were both hungry. There was a little beach cafe there. We looked at the menu and realized that it was all in French and that we had no idea what anything was. Luckily we knew what crepes and nutella were, and burger in french is just "burger" so that is what we ordered. The guy switched to english pretty quickly. I would later learn that the guy running the place spoke French, English, Dutch, and Spanish. I can't even imagine. There was some public beach, but most was taken up by the hotels on the coast.

There was a bit of a peninsula that reached out to some other docks. It gave us a pretty good ocean view of Cannes.

We [walked](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Le+point+break/Cannes+Yachting+Festival,+Prom+Panti%C3%A9ro,+06400+Cannes,+France/@43.5489578,7.0237625,1799m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x12ce81308b3b04fd:0xbe821ce479887eed!2m2!1d7.0326977!2d43.546398!1m5!1m1!1s0x12ce818e858b39f9:0x1204cc63124f28b0!2m2!1d7.0142288!2d43.5509548!3e2) down the beach road. We got a water at a different little beach vendor then sat and watched some bocce ball. There were some courts that a couple of teams were pretty intensly competing at. We would see the same people competing over the next few days. I don't know what they did for day jobs, but it was like 2 in the afternoon so they must have got it all figured out.

![Bocce ball](https://i.imgur.com/8KGhHw4.jpg)

Cannes is part of the French Riviera so there is a ton of money. On the beach road there was stores like Rolex and Louis Vuitton. You couldn't even just walk into the stores. They would have some window stuff and if you liked what you saw you could ring the doorbell and they would open the outside door. Window shopping there was actual window shopping. There was a couple of stores that had doormen, but it was pretty obvious that they didn't want you to just come in and look around.

Near the bocce ball courts there was this huge gazebo thing.

![Gazebo](https://i.imgur.com/arsv8DL.jpg)

We ended up walking around until we walked past a gelato place. We ordered by point at stuff and mispronouncing the flavors. Pretty sure everyone in Cannes spoke english, but it kind of felt selfish to ask people to do so. That said they were all very friendly and as long as you were polite they would recipricate. 

### Day 3

We had very little agenda for France. The only thing that we knew is that we wanted to look at art (my request) and sit on a beach (Alex's request, but a little me too). We knew going in that we would half ass everything, because vacations where you have to plan and think the whole time are hardly vacations. So our second day in Cannes we headed to the beach. She read her book while I used mine for a pillow. Pro tip: the soft cover version of the book *IT* will double as a pillow due to its thickness. We spent a few hours there and took in some sun. We decided after to stroll down to the [local art gallery](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Malmaison/@43.5500267,7.0249394,297m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x12ce8196931cb837:0x4cae313a6d7ed317!2sLa+Malmaison!8m2!3d43.5503066!4d7.0248649!3m4!1s0x12ce8196931cb837:0x4cae313a6d7ed317!8m2!3d43.5503066!4d7.0248649) and look at some art. They were having a Max Ernst exhibit. It was very good. The gallery itself was only really 5 or 6 rooms, but it was interesting none the less.

We still had little time in the day. Everything closes down at around 6-630. So we walked down the beach road to get to the oldest part of town. There was a [musee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mus%C3%A9e+de+la+Castre/@43.5496918,7.0101312,415m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x12ce8196931cb837:0x4cae313a6d7ed317!2sLa+Malmaison!8m2!3d43.5503066!4d7.0248649!3m4!1s0x12ce811c78106eb5:0x6895f8622ddf4934!8m2!3d43.5499011!4d7.0104079) (museum) that Alex wanted to see. It was a crazy tough hike to get to. It went up the side of a very steep hill and the roads to get there wound all around. 

The museum was an old fortress that looked out on the bay. You could climb a watch tower where you could see all of Cannes. It was actually an incredibly large city. It went on for much longer than I originally thought. 

![The Bay](https://i.imgur.com/SeKYF1B.jpg)

After maybe an hour and a half we decided that it was time for some dinner. Getting food in France is weird. The roads or paths between buildings are very small, cars can't usually get into many paths. As you walk through any city, Cannes and Paris are on polar opposites for size but dining is the exact same, there are hundreds of restaurants. There may or may not be an inside, most just set up tables in the walking paths. Most have some sort of canopy to shade customers. You walk through these as you are deciding what to eat. Their menus are all posted somewhere. We found one that had english on the menu. The thing that I still don't understand is whether or not you are supposed to just sit or not. The owner saw us standing and asked how many. I said two and she sat us at a table that was for two. 

There is very little room in these restaurants so if there is only two of you, you will be getting a two person table. That was a pretty odd thing I hadnt considered. We have so much space in the US that it's not uncommon to sit at a 4 person table when there is only 2 people. We sat next to a four person table. "Next to" in this case may as well been at their table. there was only maybe 6 inches between our tables. It was weird even though we were only a few inches from their table I think the language boundry made it feel like we had space. I am sure they could understand us and it's not as if we were speaking ill of them, but it gave us a comfortable cushion to feel isolated.

As an example some of the "roads" were about like this:

We got a nice picture of the sunset that night:

Bonus pic: 
This guys was riding around on a moped, like most of the population, doing wheelies.
![](https://i.imgur.com/SP2kzgX.jpg)

The guy on the right in that picture is driving one of [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aDlWSvAm9w) things. They look incredibly dorky and the first time I saw someone riding one I had to double take. They are ridiculous and stupid and I want one so much for no reason.

### Day 4

We found out there was two islands off to coast of Cannes. One of them had a musee, so we figured that would be a good thing to go check out. We went down to the docks and got tickets for Ile Sainte Marguerite. There was a yachting festival happening while we were there. It was about the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. There was yachts with helipads, small boats, and jetskis on them. There was millionaire yachts and billionaire yachts. You could tell the difference. The amount of money sitting in the water was absurd. Catamarans were zipping around, people were windsailing, there was a few fishing boats going out. The boat ride out to the ile brought you right through the middle of this surreal world. 

The ile itself was beautiful. We went up to the [musee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mus%C3%A9e+de+la+Mer/@43.5199125,7.0499434,2807m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x12ce811c78106eb5:0xb1e0cc699edad52c!8m2!3d43.5239665!4d7.0454282) right away. I think I may have lost all my pictures as I don't see any on my phone, but I know I took some. Musee de la Mar is in another abandoned fort. [Here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mus%C3%A9e+de+la+Mer/@43.5235537,7.044618,150m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x12ce811c78106eb5:0xb1e0cc699edad52c!8m2!3d43.5239665!4d7.0454282) is a zoomed in version. Right in the middle there are three buildings touching a basketball court. I don't think the basket ball court is original, but the other three are. They are bunk houses there was a summer camp of kids housed in these buildings. On the northeast side there is a building on the corner of the fort, which I guess is what they would consider the real Musee de la Mar. That was actually an old prison. You would know it as the prison that held the man in the iron mask. The view from the cell was really nice for a prison compared to say Alcatraz. 

The musee had a temporary exhibit feature Jason Taylor, who does these amazing cement sculptures and then submerges them in order to build coral reefs on them. You can find lots of good pictures of his stuff [here](https://www.underwatersculpture.com/works/submerged/).

After the musee we walked to the south west part of the island to take a look at the other island, Île Saint-Honorat, which has an [Abbey](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Abbaye+De+L%C3%A9rins/@43.506865,7.0465697,861m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x94dc4d15a5fbe815!8m2!3d43.506444!4d7.0472413) on it. We got to the viewing platform and there was a huge yacht parked right in the way, the billionaire kind. Some kid was playing with one of those [jet flyboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xndvlH4gyII). Eventually the current carried the yacht enough that we got a small glimpse.

### Day 5
