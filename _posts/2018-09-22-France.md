We got back from france a couple days ago and are almost over the jet lag. It has been 4:30 and 5:00 am wake up times the last few days. France is 7 hours ahead so waking up at 9am there was 2 in the morning here. I stayed up until midnight to try to get my clock back to normal.

## Day 1 Travelling

I don't think I've had a proper vacation in a while, something like a year and a half. I don't normalling take time off, I guess because I enjoy work. I woke up at 4am on the Sunday we left. I had a friend tell me that a great way to fight jet lag is to not eat for 16 hours and then eat at what would be breakfast time at your destination. It's supposed to reset your internal clock or something. I dunno. Anyways, I got up super early in hopes that I could get some sleep on the airplane. Our flight was to take off at 5:30 and If I fell asleep shortly there after I could get pretty close to on time for waking up.

Alex woke up a few hours later and we didn't have much to do so we went to our favorite dinner Wampach's before the morning church crowd could overrun it. We did stuff round the house after and then headed to the airport. We parked at an off-site ramp and shuttled to the airport to save a few bucks. In retrospective, we probably should have taken a cab since it would have come out to about the same price. As the flight takes off I started watching [*Isle of Dogs*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/) which I had missed in theaters. It's a pretty laid back movie so as I started to fall asleep watching it Alex woke me up thinking I was awake. I got about 15 minutes and that rejarred my brain awake to finish the movie. I then watched something else, I forget what and I guess it doesn't matter. 

We got dinner served and I tried unsuccessfully to fall asleep a few more times. After 7 hour flying across the ocean we landed in Paris. at this point it was about 7am there. We had to clear customs which took about 5 minutes and no dumb questions about where we were and why? We had a connecting flight in a different terminal. This was kind of when it started to hit me that neither of us spoke French. I was doing some Babbel courses to get some basics down, but neither of us knew much. We (Alex) managed to figure out where to go. The airport was well laid out and there were just enough english markers to get by. 

Our connecting flight was a couple hours from when we landed and we were both pretty tired at this point. The terminal we were at was really beautiful, but it was built like a triangle so that the far side converged into a point. This would have been fine, except that there were 4 gates less than 100 feet apart. The flight at the gate ahead of us was delayed waiting for someone, so our flight was a little late as well. We got on and made the jump down to Nice. Nice is about a 30-40 minute drive southwest of Monaco where the famous Monaco Grand Prix is held. Our first night in France would be in the town of Cannes, pronounced "Can", because the French don't use most of the letters they write.

We found the airport bus terminal and I muttered "deux for Can." They picked up I was american pretty quickly and switched the conversation to english pretty quickly. This would be an overall process to every conversation we would have while in France. We got the tickets and struggled to find the actual bus terminal. Alex ended up finding the right parking lot and we got on the bus. 

She ended up getting sleep on the bus, though the drive wasn't long. We ended up at ["Gare de Cannes"](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cannes,+France/@43.5536843,7.0197858,18.25z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x12ce8180530cffff:0x40819a5fd979e20!8m2!3d43.552847!4d7.017369) It was about [1 km](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Gare+de+Cannes,+4+Place+de+la+Gare,+06400+Cannes,+France/Clarion+Suites+Cannes+Croisette+****,+Rue+Latour-Maubourg,+Cannes,+France/@43.552112,7.0227555,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x12ce81925828015f:0x3b9b2f7c61606d81!2m2!1d7.0195453!2d43.5539536!1m5!1m1!1s0x12ce81bdc89fb7b5:0x44cc31ba34a0214b!2m2!1d7.03032!2d43.550046!3e2) from out first hotel. We decided to walk. Coming from the midwest Cannes was eye opening. Alex and I both have backpacks and suitcases in a place where neither of us speak the language, in a foreign town, with no cell signal. Luckily I had offline google maps so we found our way through some windy streets and found our first hotel. 

It was tucked away a few blocks from the beach. We were both exhausted. At this point I was running on about an hour of sleep for the last 26 hours. The front desk was very polite and switched to english pretty quickly. We got our room went upstairs and just laid on the bed. The room had a queen size mattress with a small chair and a stove, and fridge. Alex figured out that if you put your card in a slot on the wall you could turn the lights on. I am still not sure how she deduced this, but pretty much every hotel would have some form of this. It was a great way to save electricity. We both started falling asleep until she sat up quickly and said, "nope we can't go to bed yet, we have to stay up."  She was right. It was awful, but if we didn't get on schedule right away we weren't going to. 

We walked up to the beach. We were both hungry. There was a little beach cafe there. We looked at the menu and realized that it was all in French and that we had no idea what anything was. Luckily we knew what crepes and nutella were, and burger in french is just "burger" so that is what we ordered. The guy switched to english pretty quickly. I would later learn that the guy running the place spoke French, English, Dutch, and Spanish. I can't even imagine. There was some publich beach, but most was taken up by the hotels on the coast.

We got a water somewhere and sat and watched some boche ball. There was
