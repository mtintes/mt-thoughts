Let's start this blog of with something simple, tasty seasoned pretzels. I am not a big snack eater. I like to eat a little bit of something really good instead of a lot of mediocre. A friend got some pretzels from [Von Hanson's Meats](https://vonhansons.com/) and they were tasty. Now if you don't want to spend two days making pretzels, then hop in your car and go there instead. It will save you some trouble. For me I like to tinker and I figured I could probably get pretty close to that same flavor. I've brought these pretzels to work, BBQs, family events and I've never got to bring any home. 

### Ingredients

1. 1 lb. bag of pretzels
1. [16 oz. Orville Redenbacher's butter popcorn oil](https://www.target.com/p/orville-redenbacher-vegetable-oil-16oz/-/A-52302100)
1. Packet of ranch powder

I don't have exact measurements for these, so use as much or as little as you would like.

1. Chipotle (long lasting spiciness)
1. Cayenne (initial spiciness)
1. Ground mustard (levels spice out)
1. Brown sugar (what gives that sweetness you taste in bbq)
1. Von Hanson's BBQ seasoning (you can probably use any dry rub seasoning, this is what makes it taste like bbq)
1. Garlic powder (can go with or without. Use a lot if you like to accent saltiness or less if you don't)

### Directions

You will need to mix the pretzels up two times a day for two days so depending on when you want to eat them, you'll need to start them at the right time. I like to take them to work so I start them at night a few days earlier.

1. Put the pretzels into a big bowl.
1. Pour 8oz of oil on the pretzels.
1. Cover the pretzels with the ranch powder.
1. Sprinkle on some garlic powder, chipotle, and mix all that goodness up. You want to get all the pretzels coated real good.
1. Eat a couple. This way you know how good they are. They will get better.
1. Cover them up and let them sit for a while. 
1. Mix them at the opposite time of the day. You'll mix them in the morning if you started them at night or mix them at night if you started them in the morning. It's not a science. You are just trying to get the stuff at the bottom back at the top. Cover them up again and let them sit for another 12 hours or so.
1. Great job resisting them so far, but it's going to get a whole lot harder.
1. Pour the last 8 oz of oil over the pretzels. 
1. Sprinkle on Cayenne, more Chipotle, the ground mustard, brown sugar and the BBQ seasoning. Do each one of these at a time and mix up the pretzels a little as you go. It will help to get everything coated and spread that flavor out. You can also keep tasting these as you go. Each ingredient does something on it's own as labelled in the ingredients section.
1. Cover and wait another 12 hours.
1. Mix up one more time and then pop them in a couple 1 gallon bags.
1. Eat all of them.
