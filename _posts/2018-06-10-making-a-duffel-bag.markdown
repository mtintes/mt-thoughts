As this is post one I think it's important to go over a little bit of who I am as a person. I like to tinker. I like thinking about how things are made and then making them. I also really like hockey. Luckily, these two things combine in my first project, a bag for my hockey equipment.

I got the idea for making a bag from a coworker who was using an old duffel bag from when he was in highschool. It is a green bag with yellow ends. It looked super cool and really unique. I thought that would be an easy to make design. After all, it is just a cylinder with some caps on the end. 

So why make a hockey bag? You can go to the story and pick up a decent bag for less than $100. Well to that remark I say, I dunno. I thought it would be a challenge and so I went for it. I will appologize now as I did not take any pictures until the very end but will try to get all then info I can out of those pictures.


## So some of the stuff you need for this project:

### A sewing machine

So I was really lucky here; about a year ago I thought I would learn to sew. I have an aunt who is a great seamstress and does a lot of upholestry work. She had a spare sewing machine and showed me how to use it. 

### Some canvas

You will need a couple of colors, one for them main part of the bag, one for the endcaps. I picked out colors for my winter league team which are red and white. For the main part I found a really nice red canvas, and the endcaps are sort of a dirty/off white. For the main bag I think I grabbed about 3 yards and for the white I got 1 yard. I know I didnt need that much, but I thought I could make some other stuff to go along with the bag in the future. In all, you probably only need a yard and a half of the primary color but it comes down to how much stuff you want to hold. 

### Polypropylene webbing

I recomend going to a sewing store to look for this. It comes in a few different sizes, I think I got some 2" width stuff. It comes on a small plastic wheel and is probably need where you would find like rope and ribbon. It's going to be used for a strap around the bag so you want it to be thick enough to be comfortable.

### Nylon thread

This stuff is strong and will be the guts of the bag. Find it in the main color of your bag. It doesn't have to be spot on. You are making a useful bag not the most beautiful bag. We will get the number for how much you need in the maths below.

### A Needle

You are going through some tough fabric. You will need a needle that can take a beating. Look for a number 18 or 20. Most sewing machines have the same kind of sewing needle no matter if you bought it new or if it's 40 years old. 

### A will to succeed

I'll be straight with you, between the nylon thread binding up and the webbing being a pain, this project can be a lot of annoying things. Push through it. After finishing this bag I am proud to bring it anywhere. When people tell me about something that is wrong with it I get to ask them "where's the bag you made?" and they tend to shutup. Point is it is something that no one else in your league has which makes it special.

## Let's do some maths

When you look at a duffle bag you get a cylinder like I mentioned above. The maths here are pretty easy a cylinder unrolled is just a rectangle. But how big is the cylinder? Well it will be big enough to hold your equipment. I found the size by measuring my old hockey bag, but you may not have one. If you do take a cloth measuring tape and measure around the bag and then the length.
