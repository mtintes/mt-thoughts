As this is post one I think it's important to go over a little bit of who I am as a person. I like to tinker. I like thinking about how things are made and then making them. I also really like hockey. Luckily, these two things combine in my first project, a bag for my hockey equipment.

I got the idea for making a bag from a coworker who was using an old duffel bag from when he was in highschool. It is a green bag with yellow ends. It looked super cool and really unique. I thought that would be an easy to make design. After all, it is just a cylinder with some caps on the end. 

So why make a hockey bag? You can go to the story and pick up a decent bag for less than $100. Well to that remark I say, I dunno. I thought it would be a challenge and so I went for it. I will appologize now as I did not take any pictures until the very end but will try to get all then info I can out of those pictures.


## So some of the stuff you need for this project:

### A sewing machine

So I was really lucky here; about a year ago I thought I would learn to sew. I have an aunt who is a seamstress and does a lot of upholestry work. She had a spare sewing machine and showed me how to use it. 

### Some canvas

You will need a couple of colors, one for them main part of the bag, one for the endcaps. I picked out colors for my winter league team which are red and white. For the main part I found a really nice red canvas, and the endcaps are sort of a dirty/off white. For the main bag I think I grabbed about 3 yards and for the white I got 1 yard. I know I didnt need that much, but I thought I could make some other stuff to go along with the bag in the future. In all, you probably only need a yard and a half of the primary color but it comes down to how much stuff you want to hold. 

### Polypropylene webbing

I recomend going to a sewing store to look for this. It comes in a few different sizes, I think I got some 2" width stuff. It comes on a small plastic wheel and is probably need where you would find like rope and ribbon. It's going to be used for a strap around the bag so you want it to be thick enough to be comfortable.

### A big ass metal zipper

I got a metal zipper #10. It's tough as hell. You won't need the whole thing but I would still get a 32". After all, your hockey crap is going in this bag. Might as well make it as tough as the game itself.
### Nylon thread

This stuff is strong and will be the guts of the bag. Find it in the main color of your bag. It doesn't have to be spot on. You are making a useful bag not the most beautiful bag. We will get the number for how much you need in the maths below.

### A Needle

You are going through some tough fabric. You will need a needle that can take a beating. Look for a number 18 or 20. Most sewing machines have the same kind of sewing needle no matter if you bought it new or if it's 40 years old. 

### A will to succeed

I'll be straight with you, between the nylon thread binding up and the webbing being a pain, this project can be a lot of annoying things. Push through it. After finishing this bag I am proud to bring it anywhere. When people tell me about something that is wrong with it I get to ask them "where's the bag you made?" and they tend to shutup. Point is it is something that no one else in your league has which makes it special.

## Let's do some maths

When you look at a duffle bag it works out to basically be a [cylinder](https://www.mathopenref.com/cylinderarea.html) like I mentioned above. It makes the maths here pretty easy since a cylinder unrolled is just a rectangle. But how big is the cylinder? Well, it will be big enough to hold your equipment. I found the size by measuring my old hockey bag, but you may not have one. If you do, take a cloth measuring tape and measure around the bag, as in 90 degrees to the zipper, and then measure the length of the bag. That's going to give you all the data you need. You want the bag to be a little baggy, so we will play with the numbers a little fast and loose. My measurements ended up being about 54in by 28in or something. I'm just eyeballing it from across the room. Either way my numbers aren't important how we get the rest of the numbers is. For the record if you don't have a different bag to measure against don't worry about it. Just measure around the equipment and get your bag size that way. 

Now we can take the 28 by 54 bag and that is how much of the first color canvas you will need.  To figure out the secondary color or the end caps color you will need the to take the 54 inches which is the circumference of you bag and use some formulas. 54 = 2Ï€r anyone? or maybe you fell asleep in math class. Well if you ever asked, "when am I ever going to have to use this" the answer is now. This means the radius is around 8.6 inch. We need the diameter so lets double it and say 17.2. This kind of stuff can be made a little easier by figuring out a diameter and doing some reverse math as well to keep things easy. Oh well.

Now that you have the diameter of each endcap you will know how much canvas you need from the second color. Take the 17.2 and lets call it 18 inches. One circle needs 18 inches by 18 inches of cloth to cut out a full circle. Since we need two circles one for each side of the bag we will say 36 inches by 18 inches.

As for the webbing ribbon stuff, you will need the 54 inches to go around the bag twice and then enough for two handles. so you would need at least 108 inches plus some. I have really long handles on my bag that I can throw the bag over my shoulder like a big messenger bag.

## Time to sew.

Well kind of, we need to get the cloth squared and down to the right size. Depending on your preference you maybe want to wash the fabric first. Washing the fabric can help shrink it and get you a more normalized size. I didn't wash mine, but I'm a monster, you do you. 

To get the fabric down the the right size is easy if you are a little bit clever about it. If you layed out the fabric flat and tried to cut a long line all the way across the table you will end up likely cutting a curvy line even with a straight edge that long. Instead of making that mistake you are going to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVqqefuxa2w) video. This should get you a square piece of fabric or basically get you an idea of what to do. You are going to be folding the fabric parallel to the long way. 

You want to get the 54 inches this way
